# Portfolio Project

## Day 1: Project Initialization

I initiated my portfolio project using `Vite` and integrated `Tailwind CSS` via the terminal. After setting up, I created a `Components` folder to organize all my React components. My first component was `navbar.jsx`, which I styled using Tailwind CSS.

### Key Concepts Learned:

- **Array Mapping**:  
  I learned how to effectively use the `array-map()` function by applying it in a real-world use case. Specifically, I utilized it to create dynamic navigation links in my `navbar.jsx` component. By mapping over an array of links and names, I avoided repetitive code, making the solution more efficient and maintainable.

- **Image Handling in React**:  
  I implemented image rendering in the project using React's module system, showcasing my ability to import and display images on a webpage.

## Day 2: Home Page Development

On the second day, I created the `Home.jsx` component, focusing on styling and the integration of the `react-icons` library to enhance the visual aspect of the page.

### Key Concepts Learned:

- **React Icons**:  
  I explored how to implement icons using the `react-icons` library. After installing it via the terminal, I was able to seamlessly integrate a variety of icons into my project, improving the UI's look and feel.
