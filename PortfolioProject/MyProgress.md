# Portfolio Project

## Day 1: Project Initialization

I initiated my portfolio project using `Vite` and integrated `Tailwind CSS` via the terminal. After setting up, I created a `Components` folder to organize all my React components. My first component was `navbar.jsx`, which I styled using Tailwind CSS.

### Key Concepts Learned:

- **Array Mapping**:  
  I learned how to effectively use the `array-map()` function by applying it in a real-world use case. Specifically, I utilized it to create dynamic navigation links in my `navbar.jsx` component. By mapping over an array of links and names, I avoided repetitive code, making the solution more efficient and maintainable.

- **Image Handling in React**:  
  I implemented image rendering in the project using React's module system, showcasing my ability to import and display images on a webpage.

## Day 2: Home Page Development

On the second day, I created the `Home.jsx` component, focusing on styling and the integration of the `react-icons` library to enhance the visual aspect of the page.

### Key Concepts Learned:

- **React Icons**:  
  I explored how to implement icons using the `react-icons` library. After installing it via the terminal, I was able to seamlessly integrate a variety of icons into my project, improving the UI's look and feel.

- **Typing effect on the page**: 
  For, Creating the cool typing effect on the home page, I used `typed` liberary. Which is easy to implemnent into the project and after exploring some doct i feagured out how to use this lib. And added this cool effect on my page.

## Day 3: About Page Development


  On the third day, I created the `about.jsx` component, it was bit easy day for me cuz i just need to pic the images from the internet as per i need and then display them into my web-page.

  ### Key Concepts Learned: 

  - **Grid Property**:
  First of all i used grid property into my page, which was besically for aligning my card which contain the iamge's and information about me.

  - **Image Layer**:
  Then i made image layer for my page, because i wanted to add some animation when i hover into my image and then my text should be shown into it. So for acheiving this, we made our image `abosolute-inset-0` and set `opacity-100` to `opacity-0` when hovering on image. And then we add some simple animation into it.


  - **Text Layer**: 
  Now, the idea was simple. I just need to add some text when i hover into the card and image should be disappear. So, in above step we saw that image is totally disappeard so now we need to add text and make it visible into the page. We added the same code of image layer into it, like: `group-hover` effect `opacity-0` to `opacity-100` and `transition` effect too.

  - **List item into an array**:

  An, another concept i learned was, we can add my list item into my array by using `fregment` in my `jsx`.
